= User Authentication & Context Management
pl-sclai System Design
:toc:
:toc-title: Table of Contents

== Overview
This document outlines the authentication and context management strategy for `pl-sclai`, accommodating both an **interactive REPL** and a **stateless REST API**.

- The REPL maintains a **global context and user state**.
- The REST API requires **explicit authentication and session context** with each request.
- Context switching across users enforces **re-authentication** to prevent session hijacking.
- A logout **invalidates authentication tokens**, ensuring users cannot retain access after switching accounts.

== Authentication Model
Authentication in `pl-sclai` is token-based. Upon successful login, the system:

- Generates a **unique auth token**.
- Stores it in MongoDB under `/tame/auth/<token>.json`:
+
[source,json]
----
{"user": "<username>"}
----

- Returns the token to the client.

=== Token Usage
Each **API call** must include:

- The **auth token** (proving user identity).
- The **context session ID** (specifying which chat session to use).

Example API request:

+
[source]
----
POST /api/chat
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>
Body:
  {
    "context": "20250314120012345-ctx",
    "message": "Tell me about AI."
  }
----

=== Preventing Unauthorized Context Use

- The server verifies that the **user associated with the auth token** matches the **user assigned to the requested context**.
- If they mismatch, the request is **denied**.

== Handling Logout
A **logout request**:

- Deletes the auth token from MongoDB (`/tame/auth/<token>.json`).
- Ensures that a **future request with the old token is rejected**.

This prevents:

- Persistent sessions from unauthorized reuse.
- Users from retaining access to a prior user's session.

== Managing Contexts in REPL vs. REST API

=== REPL (Stateful)
- Uses **global variables** (`current_user`, `active_context`).
- If a context switch **changes to another user's session**, a **re-login is required**.

Example workflow:
. User logs in as `alice`.
. `active_context = "alice-session-1"`
. If `active_context` is changed to `"bob-session-1"`, enforce **re-authentication**.

=== REST API (Stateless)
- Each request is **independent**.
- Requires **explicit authentication and context session ID**.
- No **persistent global state** between calls.

== Future Refinements & Considerations

While not in scope now, future refinements may address:

=== Token Expiry
Currently, tokens persist until logout. A **time-based expiration** mechanism could:

- Store a `created_at` timestamp:
+
[source,json]
----
{"user": "alice", "created_at": "2025-03-14T12:30:45Z"}
----
- Auto-revoke tokens after a set duration (e.g., **24 hours**).

*Practical Consideration:*
This would require an **expiry check on every request**, potentially impacting performance.

=== Handling Multiple Active Sessions
Currently, logging in **overwrites any existing session token**. Future options:
. **Single active session** (force logout of previous login).
. **Multiple active sessions** (store multiple tokens per user).

*Practical Consideration:*
Allowing multiple sessions would require **session tracking** per device.

=== Preventing Token Replay Attacks
If a **stolen token** is reused after logout, it should be invalid.

Solution:
- Store a **user secret** (`/tame/user/<username>.json`):
+
[source,json]
----
{"secret": "abc123xyz"}
----
- Each login **regenerates** this secret, invalidating all previous tokens.

*Practical Consideration:*
Would require **modifying the auth verification process** to check against the latest secret.

=== Race Conditions on Context Switching
- Rapidly switching contexts in concurrent requests could cause inconsistencies.
- A **context session lock** could:
  - Prevent changes **within a short time window**.
  - Ensure a request is **processed with the intended context**.

*Practical Consideration:*
Would require **locking mechanisms in MongoDB** to avoid data conflicts.

== Conclusion
The current design is **simple and effective** for managing authentication and context security. Future refinements will introduce **token expiration, multiple sessions, replay attack prevention, and race condition handling** as needed.

For now:

- **REPL enforces global user-context alignment**.
- **REST API requires explicit authentication & session context per request**.
- **Logout ensures token invalidation**, preventing unauthorized access.

This approach ensures **robust yet lightweight security** while supporting both **interactive and stateless usage models**.
